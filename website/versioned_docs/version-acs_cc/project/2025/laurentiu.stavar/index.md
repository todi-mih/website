## Description
A fully interactive BlackJack game machine built on a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - RP2350A**, using the **Rust** programming language and Embassy async framework.

### Features:
+ Uses three buttons for game actions: **HIT**, **STAND** and **START GAME**.
+ Displays dealer and player cards across **8 OLED 0.96" screens**.
+ Includes **1 OLED 0.96" display** dedicated to real-time game state messages.
+ Uses **2 RGB LEDs** to indicate turns and round outcomes.
+ Utilizes a **TCA9548A I2C multiplexer** to manage identical OLED addresses.
+ Executes full BlackJack logic: card drawing, user input, dealer logic, and win conditions.

## Motivation
This project combines microcontroller programming, real-time interaction, and game logic design. My goal was to build something fun and visually interactive, while pushing the limits of what I learned in embedded systems and Rust. The integration of I2C multiplexing, OLED control, and user inputs made this an ideal project to consolidate theory into a challenging and rewarding practical application.

## Architecture
The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - RP2350A** acts as the central unit, managing peripherals and orchestrating the game flow.

- **Buttons** (GPIO): detect user input (HIT / STAND / START GAME).
- **RGB LEDs** (PWM): blink or hold to indicate whose turn or the round outcome.
- **9 OLED Display 0.96"s** (I2C): show player/dealer cards and the game state.
- **TCA9548A I2C MUX**: used to route communication between the Pico and the OLEDs sharing the same I2C address.

### Game Flow Summary:
1. **Startup**: OLED instructs user to press START.
2. **Dealer draws 2 cards** – LED blinks – game state updates.
3. **Player draws 2 cards** – LED blinks – game state updates.
4. **Player phase**: can HIT (get card) or STAND (end turn).
5. **If player busts**: game ends.
6. **Else**: dealer draws to at least 17.
7. **Compare scores**: show result and reset after 5 seconds.

### LED & OLED Usage
- Blinking LEDs indicate **active turn**.
- Solid yellow LED indicates **winner** or **draw**.
- OLEDs visually show each card and game progress.

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - RP2350A**  
   - Main microcontroller; handles game logic, I2C communication, and peripheral control.

2. **2 Push Buttons (HIT & STAND)**  
   - User input; GPIO with pull-ups.

3. **2 RGB LEDs**  
   - Visual indicators for player/dealer turn and result status.

4. **9 OLED 0.96" Displays (128x64)**  
   - Display game content (cards and messages). All share the same I2C address.

5. **TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer**  
   - Routes signals to individual OLEDs as they can't share the bus directly.

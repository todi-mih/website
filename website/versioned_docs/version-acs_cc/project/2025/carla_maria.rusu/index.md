## Description

This project implements a compact WAV audio player using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller.
The audio files are stored on a microSD card, read via SPI, and played through an I2S DAC (UDA1334A) connected to a 3.5mm headphone jack.
The user can use the push buttons and the rotary encoder to customize the experience.

---

## Motivation

The motivation for choosing this project was to explore embedded audio playback using Rust and Embassy on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.
The goal was to build a music player while learning low-level embedded I/O, SPI, I2S, and async execution using Rust.

## Architecture

### Components Overview

| Component           | Responsibility                                                 |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audio Handler       | Reads WAV files and streams audio via I2S to the DAC           |
| SPI Handler         | Interfaces with the SD card to access audio files and with the LCD to display information                                                                            |
| UI                  | Displays UI (e.g., file list, song name, progress)             |
| Input Handler       | Processes rotary encoder and buttons                           |
| Playback Controller | Controls playback state (play/pause, skip, etc.)               |

### Interconnection

- Input Handler dictates the state of the Playback Controller
- Playback Controller coordinates with Audio Manager and SPI Handler to stream audio.
- Audio Handler uses SPI Handler to get WAV file data.
- Playback Controller notifies UI to update the screen.

## Hardware Design

### Hardware Description

The following hardware was used:

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
- UDA1334A I2S DAC with 3.5mm jack socket
- LCD with built-in SD slot (will see if this is the best option)
- 10k potentiometer/Rotary Encoder (not sure which I will use)
- 3 push buttons
- Breadboards and jumper wires

### Schematic

Tried to do something in Kicad (not for dark mode)

## Description

The Smart Pet Water Dispenser is an automated system designed to keep pets hydrated by refilling their water bowl whenever the level drops too low. Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W, it uses a water level sensor and a water pump to maintain consistent water levels without constant human intervention.

To ensure safety and usability, the system also monitors water temperature via a sensor and displays it on an LCD screen, while an RGB LED provides status indicators (green for normal, red for errors). It also features remote connectivity for monitoring and controlling the system through a simple web interface.

## Motivation

I chose to work on this project because ensuring pets have constant access to clean water is a common challenge for many pet owners, especially during busy schedules or when away from home. As a cat owner, I have personally faced the difficulty of maintaining a reliable water supply for my pet, which motivated me to develop the Smart Pet Water Dispenser.


## Architecture

The architecture components of the Smart Pet Water Dispenser:

  - Sensor Data Processing Component – Responsible for receiving and processing input from the water level and temperature sensors. It continuously monitors the state of the system to provide relevant data to the control unit.

  -  Control Logic Component – The central decision-making unit that evaluates sensor data to trigger appropriate actions. Based on the water level and temperature readings, it decides whether to activate the water pump or signal an alert via the RGB LED.

  - Actuation and Feedback Component – Manages the response of the system to control signals. It operates the water pump to refill the bowl and uses the RGB LED to provide feedback about the system’s health (e.g., red for errors, green for normal operation).

  -  User Interface Component – Displays real-time data, such as water temperature and system status, to the user via an OLED display. It ensures visibility into the system's current state.

  - Connectivity and Remote Monitoring Component – Allows the user to monitor and control the dispenser remotely via a web interface. This module communicates with the Raspberry Pi Pico over a network to offer access to system data and control over actions such as refilling the water remotely.
